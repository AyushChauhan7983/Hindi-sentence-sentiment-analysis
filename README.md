# hindi-sentence-sentiment-analysis
This is a NLP project which takes any Hindi sentence as input and predicts whether it is a Positive or a Negative Sentence.

3. NEG_hindi.txt -> this file contains many Negative Hindi Sentences
4. POS_hindi.txt -> this file contains many Positive Hindi Sentences
5. main.py -> this is the main python file which shows the accuracy of the dataset.
6. nlp.py -> this is the frontend of the project made using streamlit
